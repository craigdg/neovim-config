# nvim config

The nvim config is used by myself and is tailored to my own requirements.


TODO:

- When focusing terminal, focus the lastSelected terminal instead of first found.
- In only terminal mode allow a keymap that moves focus to the next terminal and sets insert mode.
- Figure out a better git flow.
- Integrate btop activity?
- Figure out a find and replace flow, likely with quick fix menu.
- Bug where file occassionally has no numbers.
